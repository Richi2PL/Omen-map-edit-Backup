Omen is a map editor for Minecraft. It can make maps for creative multiplayer and indev.

It uses Java, so you will need an up to date version of java installed.


You must have the minecraft server installed in order to load/save multiplayer maps with Omen (.dat files). Omen is not a server, only an editor.
Place Omen070.jar and runOmen.bat in the same directory as minecraft-server.jar.

Double click Omen070.jar to run the editor, or use runOmen.bat to start the editor with more memory.


There WILL be bugs, so please report them in the thread here:

http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=80

You can also email me at osici@ymail.com or at the Omen site (omened.tumblr.com), but it's better to check the thread.

The next update may be a while, but I'll fix bugs/keep it up to date with minecraft where possible. This is because I want the next update to be a big one if I can, as a redesign is needed.

Omen uses the JNBT classes by Graham Edgecombe.
